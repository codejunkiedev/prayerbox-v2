# PrayerBox v2 — Documentation

How each subsystem behaves, aimed at someone changing the code. The [root README](../README.md) covers what the product is and how to get it running. Paths are relative to `src/` unless stated.

## Start here

New to the codebase? Read [Architecture](./architecture.md) first — particularly _How displays read data_, which is the single most surprising part of the system and the thing most likely to mislead you if you assume a normal Supabase client setup.

## Conventions

- Prose explains mechanism; enumerable values point at source (`constants/config.ts`, `types/supabase.ts`) rather than being copied here, because copies go stale.
- Where a value is duplicated across TypeScript and SQL, the docs say so and name both sides — `DEFAULT_EVENT_DURATION_MINUTES` and `event_ends_at()` are the standing example.
- Behaviour that looks like a bug is recorded in [Known issues](./known-issues.md) rather than described as if intended.
