# Architecture

How the app is composed, how it is secured, and how the two runtime surfaces get their data.

## Two realms

| Realm   | Routes         | Sign-in         | Store                                                    |
| ------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Console | `/admin/*`     | Supabase Auth   | `auth` → `{ masjidId, role }`                            |
| Display | `/`, `/logout` | Per-screen code | `display` → `{ loggedIn, masjidProfile, displayScreen }` |

Tracked independently, so one device can hold both. A user belongs to exactly one masjid — `masjid_members` is `UNIQUE(user_id)` — with role `admin` or `moderator`.

A masjid owns any number of screens, each with its own code, orientation, theme, language, slide interval, and independently ordered set of assigned content, so the same announcement can sit in a different position, or be hidden, on each screen.

## Routes and guards

**Routes** (`constants/routes.ts`, three enums). Public `/privacy`, `/terms`. Auth `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/login-with-code`. Console `/admin` plus `announcements`, `events`, `posts`, `youtube-videos`, `ayat-and-hadith` (+ `/new`, `/:id/edit`), `prayer-timings`, `screens` (+ `/:id`, `/:id/customize-theme`), `settings` (+ `/profile`, `/account`), `moderators`, `support`, `reset-password`.

**Guards** (`navigation/index.tsx`). Every `/admin/*` route needs a session. `RequireAdmin` additionally wraps Screens, Screen Detail, the custom-theme editor, Prayer Timings, Settings, Settings Profile, Moderators and Support, redirecting moderators to `/admin`. Content pages are open to moderators. Auth routes redirect away when a session exists; the catch-all lands on `/admin` or `/` depending on session. All 28 pages are `React.lazy` behind one Suspense fallback.

Three routes render outside `AppLayout`, with no sidebar or header: the two designer routes and the custom-theme editor.

## Frontend composition

`main.tsx` initializes i18n, Sentry, and the service worker, then renders `App` — an `ErrorBoundary` and `ThemeProvider` around `Navigation`, which holds every route and guard. Two persisted Zustand stores hold identity: `auth` for the console and the display store for screens.

## Data access

Domain services in `lib/supabase/services/` sit on generic query helpers in `lib/supabase/helpers.ts`. Types in `types/supabase.ts` are **hand-written, not generated**, and every result is cast — so schema drift is invisible at compile time. Any migration that changes a column's shape has to be mirrored here by hand.

## Security

Row-Level Security scopes every authenticated query through two `SECURITY DEFINER` SQL helpers, `get_user_masjid_id()` and `get_user_role()`, both with a pinned `search_path`. Members can CRUD content; admin-only surfaces (screens, prayer config, settings, profile, members) additionally require `get_user_role() = 'admin'`.

Moderator lifecycle runs through service-role Edge Functions, which verify the caller is an admin of the same masjid, that the target is a moderator in that masjid, and refuse to act on an admin. See [Admin console](./admin-console.md#moderators).

## How displays read data

This is the part most likely to trip you up, because it does not look like a normal Supabase client.

A display holds **no Supabase session** and runs as `anon`, which has **no `SELECT` on any content table**. The grants were revoked, not merely the policies dropped — which matters, because Postgres needs `SELECT` on a column to reference it in a `WHERE` clause, so a `?code=eq.X` filter cannot resolve through a table either.

Everything arrives through `SECURITY DEFINER` functions keyed by the screen's login code, which acts as a bearer credential: checkable, never listable, and pinned to the one masjid owning that screen.

| Function                              | Returns                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_display_session(p_code)`         | `{ screen, masjid_profile }` — backs code login                                                                                                                                  |
| `get_display_payload(p_code)`         | The whole render set in one round trip: screen, profile, `settings`, `prayer_times`, the visible playlist ordered by `display_order`, and a map of the content rows it points at |
| `get_display_prayer_settings(p_code)` | `{ settings, prayer_times }` for the prayer-times hook alone                                                                                                                     |
| `record_screen_heartbeat(p_code)`     | Stamps `screen_heartbeats.last_seen_at`                                                                                                                                          |
| `verify_screen_code(p_code)`          | A bare existence check for the TV shell; not called by this web bundle                                                                                                           |

Inside `get_display_payload` every content branch re-checks `masjid_id` against the screen's own and filters `archived = false`, with events additionally filtered by `ends_at >= now()`. The re-check is necessary because `screen_content.content_id` deliberately carries no foreign key. A null payload means the screen row is gone, and the display signs itself out.

## Realtime

Because Realtime evaluates the **subscriber's** RLS before delivering a row, those revoked grants would silence any subscription to the content tables. So the ten per-table subscriptions collapsed into one on `display_revisions` — a content-free counter, one row per masjid, bumped by a trigger on every write to `masjid_profiles`, `display_screens`, `screen_content`, `settings`, `prayer_times`, `announcements`, `events`, `posts`, `youtube_videos` and `ayat_and_hadith`.

It is the only table `anon` can still read, and **its value is never used** — the beacon is purely a signal to refetch. Both display hooks subscribe filtered by `masjid_id` and debounce 250 ms, so a burst such as a drag-reorder coalesces into one refetch.

**Heartbeats** are deliberately separate: stamped on mount and every 15 minutes, failures ignored. `screen_heartbeats` is kept out of the realtime publication and off `display_screens` so frequent writes neither wake every live screen nor rewrite the `custom_theme` blob.

## External APIs

All in `src/api/`, all abortable and Sentry-instrumented: Al-Adhan (`/calendar`, `/timings`, `/gToH`), OpenWeather (`/forecast`, metric), Geoapify (geocoding, tiles, timezone lookup), AlQuran.cloud, hadithapi.com.
