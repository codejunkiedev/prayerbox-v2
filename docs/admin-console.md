# Admin console

Authentication, the role split, and the two admin-only configuration surfaces. Content management lives in [Content](./content.md); prayer configuration in [Prayer times](./prayer-times.md).

## Authentication

Sign-up takes email, password (Zod minimum: 8 characters) and a confirmation, with a live strength meter — six checks scored 0–5, advisory only, so Zod's 8-character floor is the real rule (`utils/password-strength.ts`). Forgot-password mails a link to `/admin/reset-password`; that page redirects home 5 s after success.

HTTP 400/422/429 auth errors are ordinary user mistakes — wrong password, already registered, rate limited — and are deliberately not reported to Sentry (`lib/supabase/helpers.ts`).

**Account** (`/admin/settings/account`): change email via confirmation link; change password re-verified against the current one.

**Display login.** `/login-with-code` calls `getDisplaySession(code)` → the `get_display_session` RPC, which returns `{ screen, masjid_profile }` in one server-side call. `?code=CODE` auto-signs-in once behind a ref guard, so a device can be provisioned by URL.

## Roles

Admins do everything. Moderators manage content only — announcements, events, posts, YouTube videos, ayat & hadith — enforced client-side by `RequireAdmin` and a role-aware sidebar, and server-side by RLS granting content CRUD to any member while restricting admin tables to `get_user_role() = 'admin'`.

**Bootstrap.** Creating a masjid profile fires `on_masjid_profile_insert` → `handle_new_masjid_profile()`, which inserts an `admin` membership for the creator; the client mirrors it. A signed-up user with no membership gets a transient admin with `masjidId: null` so onboarding is reachable — during which the sidebar shows only Home, plus Settings for admins.

## Moderators

`/admin/moderators`, admin-only. There is no invite flow: the admin creates a credentialed account outright. Each action is a service-role Edge Function that verifies the caller is an admin of the same masjid, that the target is a moderator in that masjid, and refuses to touch an admin.

| Function                   | Action                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create-moderator`         | Creates the auth user (email pre-confirmed) + membership; deletes the user if the membership insert fails |
| `get-moderators`           | Lists the masjid's moderators, enriched with email                                                        |
| `update-moderator`         | Name and/or email                                                                                         |
| `reset-moderator-password` | Sets a new password                                                                                       |
| `revoke-moderator`         | Deletes membership then the auth user, invalidating sessions                                              |

Moderators sign in through the same `/login` page; the role only restricts what they see and can do.

## Masjid profile

`/admin/settings/profile`, admin-only, table `masjid_profiles`.

Fields: `name`, `name_ur`, `name_ar`, `area`, `area_ur`, `area_ar`, `logo_url`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `timezone`, `contact_number`, `contact_email`, `website`. Localized fields render RTL in the matching script font and are optional; contact fields are optional but format-validated when present.

**Timezone is required** and is the masjid's wall clock for everything downstream. It is normally derived automatically: moving the map pin reverse-geocodes through Geoapify and accepts the result only if it looks like an IANA id. A `TimezonePicker` combobox over `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')` is the manual fallback — it handles renamed zones (Kolkata/Calcutta), prepends a non-canonical saved value, and degrades to free text where the runtime lists nothing. Postgres validates against `pg_timezone_names` in a trigger, and the column is `NOT NULL`.

**Location** is a Leaflet modal on Geoapify `osm-bright` tiles: click to place, "locate me" with distinct permission/unavailable/timeout messages, and a search box debounced 400 ms at a 3-character minimum. Default centre is Islamabad/Rawalpindi.

Logos upload to `masjid-logos/<masjid_id>/<timestamp>` so storage RLS can scope by folder. On a first-ever profile the logo uploads after the insert, then patches `logo_url`.

## Display screens

Table `display_screens`, service `services/screens.ts`, managed at `/admin/screens` and `/admin/screens/:id`.

| Field                               | Values                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                              | text                                                                                                                  |
| `code`                              | 7 chars over `0-9a-z`, generated with `crypto.getRandomValues` and rejection sampling — it is a credential, not an id |
| `orientation`                       | `landscape` / `portrait`                                                                                              |
| `theme`                             | `theme-1`…`theme-4`                                                                                                   |
| `custom_theme`                      | JSON or null — see [Display runtime](./display.md#themes)                                                             |
| `language`                          | `en` / `ur` / `ar`                                                                                                    |
| `slide_interval_seconds`            | 5–60, default 5; videos ignore it                                                                                     |
| `show_prayer_times`, `show_weather` | booleans                                                                                                              |
| `prayer_alert_triggers`             | subset of `['athan','iqamah']`, default empty — see [Display runtime](./display.md#prayer-alerts)                     |
| `prayer_alert_sound`                | `beep` (default) or `silent` — **no UI control; `silent` is reachable only in the database**                          |

**Assignment.** `screen_content` is a polymorphic join of `{ screen_id, content_id, content_type, display_order, visible }` over the five content types. From a content row, the Screens action lists all screens with pre-checked boxes; saving diffs the selection, deleting removals and appending additions at `max(display_order) + 1`. Posts **and** ayat & hadith slides filter the list by orientation and banner how many screens were hidden. The assignment modal opens automatically right after creating an item.

**Order and visibility live on the join**, so the same item sits at a different position, or hidden, on each screen. The detail page's table is drag-reorderable (writing contiguous `display_order`) with an optimistic visibility switch. It also hosts the theme picker, which renders only when `show_prayer_times` is on.

**Last seen.** Displays stamp `screen_heartbeats` through an RPC every 15 minutes, and the screens list renders the relative time, or "Never". There is **no threshold and no online/offline computation anywhere** — treat it as last-seen, not status.

Deleting a screen is a hard delete.
